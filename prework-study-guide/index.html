        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is used to create the structure of a webpage. It is made up of elements that work together to provide content and the basic framework for all webpages.</li>
          <li>An <strong>element</strong> is a type of content on a webpage.</li> 
          <li>Text, Image, Header, and List elements are commonly used to add content to webpages.</li>
          <li>Meta-related, Content, and Semantic elements are commonly used to divide and describe a page.</li>
          <li>The <strong>head</strong> element contains information about the webpage.</li>
          <li>The <strong>body</strong> element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>
          <li>An <strong>element</strong> refers to the entire element from opening tag to closing tag. A <strong>tag</strong> refers only to what appears inside the angle brackets.</li>
          <li>Elements that are nested inside other elements are called <strong>child elements</strong>. The element that holds all the children is known as the <strong>parent element</strong>.</li>
          <li><strong>Semantic HTML elements</strong> describe the content they contain and the role they play on a webpage.</li>
          <li>An HTML <strong>attribute</strong> defines additional information about an element. Attributes are always defined in the beginning element and never the closing element.</li>        
          <li><strong>Metadata</strong> is data about our webpage that the browser uses to effectively serve our webpage to users. Metadata is typically not seen by users, but it contains important information about accessibility, search engines, and performance.</li>
          <li><strong>Search engine optimization (SEO)</strong> is the process of improving the ranking of a website in search engines such as Google or Bing. Better SEO results in your website more frequently showing up in searches.</li>

        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a programming language used by developers to define how webpage content is presented to users. It defines the colors, aesthetics, visual layout, and organization.</li>
          <li>There are three ways to style a webpage using CSS: inline, internal, and external.</li>
          <li>When a developer wants to style an element directly in the HTML file, they use inline CSS. Inline styles apply to a specific HTML tag, using a style attribute with a CSS rule to style a particular page element only. They're useful for quick and permanent changes but are less flexible than external and internal style sheets, because each inline style must be edited individually whenever you make a design change.</li>
          <li>Internal style sheets contain CSS rules for the webpage in the head section of the HTML file. The rules only apply to that page and you can configure CSS classes and IDs, which are used to identify elements, to style multiple elements in the page code.</li>
          <li>The most common way to style a webpage is by using an external CSS style sheet. They allow developers to keep all their CSS rules in a separate file, which makes design changes easier.</li>
          <li>Separation of concerns is a widely used term in web development and refers to separating code into different files based on use. It is based on the idea that each section of code should have its own responsibility.</li>
          <li>Do Not Repeat Yourself (DRY) is a coding principle that encourages developers to reuse or share pieces of code in order to reduce the number of lines of code that need to be written or maintained. DRY can greatly reduce the overall size and complexity of a codebase.</li>
          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
          <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
        </ul>
