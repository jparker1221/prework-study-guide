        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>HTML stands for "Hypertext Markup Language".</li>
          <li>An <strong>element</strong> is a type of content on a webpage.</li> 
          <li>Text, Image, Header, and List elements are commonly used to add content to webpages.</li>
          <li>Meta-related, Content, and Semantic elements are commonly used to divide and describe a page.</li>
          <li>The <strong>head</strong> element contains information about the webpage.</li>
          <li>The <strong>body</strong> element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>
          <li>An <strong>element</strong> refers to the entire element from opening tag to closing tag. A <strong>tag</strong> refers only to what appears inside the angle brackets.</li>
          <li>Elements that are nested inside other elements are called <strong>child elements</strong>. The element that holds all the children is known as the <strong>parent element</strong>.</li>
          <li><strong>Semantic HTML elements</strong> describe the content they contain and the role they play on a webpage.</li>
          <li>An HTML <strong>attribute</strong> defines additional information about an element. Attributes are always defined in the beginning element and never the closing element.</li>        
          <li><strong>Metadata</strong> is data about our webpage that the browser uses to effectively serve our webpage to users. Metadata is typically not seen by users, but it contains important information about accessibility, search engines, and performance.</li>
          <li><strong>Search engine optimization (SEO)</strong> is the process of improving the ranking of a website in search engines such as Google or Bing. Better SEO results in your website more frequently showing up in searches.</li>
